<h1>About</h1>

<p>Q To-Do is a simple to-do list organizer for MeeGo/Harmattan, Mer (Nemomobile, Plasma Active), and Desktops (both Linux and Windows). It features a clear, simple, and easy to use user interface.</p>

<p>Q To-Do allows to maintain nested to-dos as well as notes and sketches. You can indicate the importance of a to-do via four colors, edit to-dos, notes, and sketches, and mark to-dos as done. A progress bar shows a summary about nested to-dos.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you can easily synchronize your to-dos with your desktop. Please note that you need to have an e-mail account that supports IMAP and the Q To-Do desktop version for this.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>On the first start no entries will be present. To add new entries simply click &quot;+&quot; in the toolbar. Please note: there are two types (For now, we skip sketches.) of entries "to-dos" and "notes". To-dos can have subentries, notes don't.</p>

<p>To navigate to sub-entries of a to-do simply swipe from right to left. You should see the list move side-ways as you do it. Alternatively, you can click the small button on the right side of a to-do entry. To navigate to the parent items simply swipe from left to right or click the arrow pointing to the left in the toolbar.</p>

<p>To add sub-entries to a new todo entry simply navigate to the list showing the sub-entries as described above. You will see an empty list. There you can then add new entries the same way you did before after Q To-Do was started for the first time.</p>

<p>A "progress" bar indicates the progress of to-dos containing other to-dos. See also the screenshots below.</p>

<p>To reorder entries use a two finger gesture. Select the entry you want to move, keep it pressed, and with a second finger move up or down.</p>

<p>Double-clicking an entry opens the edit field. Long-pressing opens a menu with more options.</p>
